  Main components and design choices of the engine. You should read that.

- [Particles](https://3dreamengine.github.io/3DreamEngine/docu/particles)
  The 3D-version of loves spritebatches, designed to draw 2D Images with high performance

- [Skeletons](https://3dreamengine.github.io/3DreamEngine/docu/skeletons)
  Skeletal Animations

- [Shaders](https://3dreamengine.github.io/3DreamEngine/docu/particles)

# Development

Due to rapid changes to 3Dream I am working on a separate beta branch.

# Documentation

Undocumented features are subject to change. They will receive proper documentation once finished.

[Documentation hosted on GitHub](https://3dreamengine.github.io/3DreamEngine/)

# How to use?

```lua
--load 3DreamEngine
dream = require("3DreamEngine")

--optionally set settings
dream:setBloom(3)

--init (applies settings)
dream:init()

--loads a object
yourObject = dream:loadObject("examples/monkey/object")

--creates a light
light = dream:newLight("point", vec3(3, 2, 1), vec3(1.0, 0.75, 0.2), 50.0)

--add shadow to light source
light:addShadow()

function love.draw()
	--prepare for rendering
	dream:prepare()
	
	--add light
	dream:addLight(light)
	
	--rotate, offset and draw
	yourObject:resetTransform()
	yourObject:rotateY(love.timer.getTime())
	yourObject:translate(0, 0, -3)
	dream:draw(yourObject)
	
	--render
	dream:present()
end

function love.update()
	--update resource loader
	dream:update()
end
```

# Examples

We have examples in the `examples` folder. The provided main.lua contains a demo selection screen.

# Note
The 3d engine is working (check out the examples) however the documentation is being worked on be patient!

# Features
* loading and rendering .obj files
* very fast rendering with z-buffer and vertex shaders
* inbuilt screen space ambient occlusion (ssao)
* inbuilt distance fog
* object merging to draw several objects at once
* load and render custom vertex lists
* load one big .obj as atlas and automatically split it up into sub objects

# In progress
* diffuse maps, specular maps, normal maps
* particle systems
* custom shaders (water waves, leaves, waving grass)
* 3D polygons
* point-source lightning

# Examples
We have examples in the examples folder. To run them, require the main.lua within the example. E.g. require("examples/monkey/main").
